Gambeta Privacy Policy
${effectiveDate}

1. Overview
Gambeta ("we", "our", "us") is a soccer community platform that helps players find fields and games, join groups, chat, participate in tournaments, vote on MVPs, and track ratings. This Privacy Policy explains what we collect, how we use it, how it’s shared, and your choices.

By using Gambeta, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

2. Information We Collect
A. Information You Provide
- Account details: email, password (hashed by our auth provider), display name, username, photo (optional), and profile details you add.
- Social sign-in: When you use Google or Apple Sign In, we receive basic profile info and an identity token from those providers.
- User-generated content: messages, reactions, images, group names, team info, and other content you submit in chats and groups.
- Tournament data: team membership, payment status flags, readiness states, and related tournament settings.
- Feedback and support: content of messages you send to support.

B. Information Collected Automatically
- Device and app info: device type, OS version, app version, language, time zone.
- Diagnostic data: basic error and crash logs (if available) to improve stability and security.
- Usage data: feature usage, screens viewed, time spent, generic interaction events.

C. Location and Sensors
- Location (foreground/background, if permitted): to show nearby fields/events, help with community features, provide map experiences, and optional heatmap-style activity views.
- Motion and heading: to power compass/map orientation features (if permitted).
You can disable permissions at the system level. Some features may not work without them.

D. Notifications
- Push token: we store your device token to send app notifications (e.g., messages, team updates, tournament reminders). You can disable notifications in system settings.

E. Payment Information
- Payment processing: When enabled, payments are handled by Stripe and/or Apple Pay. We do not store full card numbers. We may receive limited payment metadata (e.g., payment status, amounts, last four digits within processor token response, and transaction identifiers) required to confirm payments.

3. How We Use Information
We use information to:
- Authenticate users and maintain accounts.
- Provide core features: chat, groups, friend connections, events, tournaments, player ratings, matchmaking, notifications, and profile experiences.
- Operate and improve the app (e.g., performance, reliability, usability, and safety).
- Enforce our Terms, prevent fraud and abuse, and protect the community.
- Communicate with you about updates, security alerts, and support.
- Comply with legal obligations.

Legal bases (where applicable): performance of a contract, legitimate interests (e.g., platform operation and safety), consent (e.g., optional permissions), and compliance with legal obligations.

4. How We Share Information
A. With Other Users
- Public profile: Your display name, username, and photo may be visible to others. Group members see messages and shared content within that group. Team participants may see team rosters and basic progress states.
- Ratings and achievements: Certain community-facing stats (e.g., rating tiers or performance indicators) may be visible in the app where relevant.

B. Service Providers and Partners
- Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Messaging), Google Sign-In, Apple Sign In, Google Maps/Places, Stripe, Apple Pay: to enable authentication, hosting, push notifications, maps, and payments.
- These providers process data on our behalf and under their own terms.

C. Legal, Safety, and Compliance
- We may disclose information to comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, or enforceable government requests, and to protect rights, property, safety, and the integrity of our services.

We do not sell your personal information.

5. Data Retention
We retain information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. We may retain certain logs and security records for a reasonable period.

6. Your Choices and Rights
- Access, update, delete: You can request access, correction, or deletion of your data. Some data is required to maintain an account.
- Permissions: You can adjust location and notifications in system settings.
- Marketing: We currently do not use invasive advertising or cross-app tracking.
- Region-specific rights: Depending on your jurisdiction (e.g., EEA/UK, California), you may have additional rights such as data portability and the right to object or limit certain processing. Contact us to exercise these rights.

7. Children’s Privacy
Gambeta is not intended for individuals under 13. If we learn we collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete it.

8. Security
We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect your information (e.g., encryption in transit, role-based access). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

9. International Transfers
Your data may be processed in countries with different data protection laws than your own. We take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards when transferring data internationally.

10. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy. If we make material changes, we will provide notice in the app or by other reasonable means. Your continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.

You understand and voluntarily accept all risks, known and unknown, associated with participation, warmups, spectating, and related activities.

5. Waiver and Release of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, you release and discharge the Organizer, its affiliates, owners, officers, directors, employees, volunteers, agents, sponsors, venue owners/managers, and vendors (“Released Parties”) from any and all claims, demands, causes of action, damages, losses, costs, or liabilities of any kind (including attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to injury, illness, property damage, or death connected to your participation, except to the extent caused by the Released Parties’ willful misconduct or gross negligence where such exclusion is not permitted by law.

7. Medical Authorization and Emergency Care
You authorize the Organizer and medical personnel to secure and/or provide first aid and emergency medical treatment deemed necessary for you (or the minor Participant). You are responsible for all related costs. You certify you have no medical condition that would make participation unsafe and acknowledge it is your responsibility to consult a physician before participating.

8. Insurance
Organizer does not provide personal health or accident insurance for Participants. You are encouraged to maintain adequate medical and personal liability insurance.

9. Weather, Facility, and Force Majeure
Events may be delayed, modified, or canceled due to weather, facility issues, safety concerns, or circumstances beyond the Organizer’s reasonable control (including acts of God, public health directives, strikes, or governmental actions). Reasonable efforts will be made to communicate changes and, where possible, provide rescheduling options as set out in Section 12.

10. Photo, Audio, and Video Consent
You grant Organizer a worldwide, royalty-free license to capture, use, reproduce, and display photographs, video, and audio of the event that may include your likeness for legitimate promotional and operational purposes in any media, without additional compensation. If you object, notify support@gambeta.app prior to the event; Organizer will use reasonable efforts to accommodate, subject to operational feasibility.

11. Data and Communications
Organizer may process personal data (e.g., name, email, team info, participation status, and payment metadata) to operate the tournament, communicate updates, and ensure safety and compliance. See our Privacy Policy at https://gambetaapp.com/privacy.

12. Payments, Fees, Refunds, and Cancellations
12.1 Entry Fees. Entry fees and any applicable taxes or processing charges will be displayed at checkout. You are responsible for ensuring accurate payment details.
12.2 Confirmation Window. A team is “Confirmed” when minimum roster and any tournament compliance requirements are met and validated by Organizer. Unless otherwise stated, the team registration confirmation window is five (5) days from initial registration (“Confirmation Window”).
12.3 Refunds and Cancellations.
  a) If a team is not Confirmed within the Confirmation Window, the pending payment authorization will be released/canceled (see Section 13 for Stripe timing details).
  b) If Organizer cancels the tournament in full prior to commencement, entry fees for impacted teams will be refunded or the authorization will be released.
  c) If an event is postponed, Organizer may offer rescheduling or refund/authorization release; details will be communicated at the time of the change.
  d) Once a team is Confirmed and the authorization is captured, fees are generally non-refundable except where required by law or if Organizer cancels the event without reschedule.
  e) Individual withdrawals after team Confirmation are handled by the team representative; Organizer does not split or prorate team fees unless explicitly stated.

13. Stripe Payment Authorization and Holds
13.1 Processor. Payments are processed by Stripe, Inc. (“Stripe”). Organizer does not store full card numbers. Stripe may retain tokens and limited metadata necessary to process transactions.
13.2 Authorization. At registration, your payment method may be authorized for the entry fee amount (and applicable taxes/fees). This is a pending charge/hold, not a final capture.
13.3 Capture on Confirmation. Upon team Confirmation, Organizer may capture the authorized amount. If the team is not Confirmed by the end of the Confirmation Window, Organizer will instruct Stripe to cancel/release the authorization.
13.4 Release Timing. Bank release times vary. Your bank may take several business days to reflect the release. Organizer is not responsible for banking delays.
13.5 Declines and Chargebacks. If a payment is declined or later disputed/charged back, Organizer may remove the team/Participant and pursue remedies consistent with tournament rules and applicable law.

14. Rules of Play and Discipline
You acknowledge receipt of and agree to follow the official tournament rules, including but not limited to: match duration, tiebreakers, roster limits, identification checks, substitution rules, equipment requirements, and discipline protocols (yellow/red cards, suspensions). Referee and Organizer decisions are final.

15. No Warranties; Limitation of Liability
The event and facilities are provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE.” To the maximum extent permitted by law, Released Parties disclaim all warranties (express or implied) and limit total liability for any claims to the amount actually paid for your entry fee or USD $50, whichever is greater. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; such limitations shall apply to the fullest extent permitted.

16. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
This Agreement is governed by the laws of [GOVERNING_JURISDICTION]. Any disputes shall be brought in the courts located in [VENUE_FOR_DISPUTES], unless local law provides otherwise. If any provision is held invalid, the remaining provisions remain in full force and effect.

17. Minors
If the Participant is under 18, a parent or legal guardian must sign. The parent/guardian accepts and agrees to this Agreement on behalf of the minor, including the assumption of risk, waiver, release, and indemnification provisions.

18. Electronic Signatures and Consent
You consent to transact electronically and to use electronic signatures. By checking the acknowledgment boxes and signing below within the Gambeta app, you agree your electronic signature has the same force and effect as a handwritten signature.
